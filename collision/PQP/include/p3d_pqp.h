//! This structure is used to know which object pairs must pass
//! the collision test.
//! Each p3d_obj variable has a pqpID field (see p3d.h).
//! This field is an index in the obj_obj array.
//! For instance, obj_obj[body1->pqpID][body2->pqpID]= 1
//! means that the collision between body1 and body2 will be tested
//! while obj_obj[body1->pqpID][body2->pqpID]= 0 means that it will not be tested.
//! There is one static pqp_collision_grid declared in p3d_pqp.c.
//! It is initialized with the pqp_create_collision_pairs() function.
//! If objects are deleted (robot bodies or environment obstacles),
//! it must be cleaned and reinitialized.
//! NB: obj_obj is symetric and should be kept symetric.
//! colliding_body1 and colliding_body2 are the two bodies 
//! that were reported as colliding in the last collision test.

//! NB: the PQP module uses the p3d_BB of Move3D as a quick pre-test (with the p3d_BB_overlap_ functions).
//! They must be computed before starting PQP (it is done in p3d_col_start) and updated.
