The PdbNM tool was created for testing purposes and was (initially) supposed to:
- take as input a PDB file and an .eigenrtb file (Normal modes calculated by ElNemo) plus
- a Vi vector index (between 1 and 56)  and
- an amplitude
and create as an output another PDB file with the coordinates from the first increased as indicated by the Vi vector of the Normal Modes.
